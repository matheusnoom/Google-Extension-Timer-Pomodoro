#### Project developed by me, with the designer made by [Gabriel Dario.](https://github.com/dxosen)
## Project description:
- A Google Pomodoro Timer extension with input time in minutes to focus and break.

- The pomodoro method is a study methodology where a time is predetermined to remain 100% focused and when you finish, you have a time to rest, thus being a loop until the completion of the task.

- With input of two integers different from 0, one of them destined to focus and the other to a rest break. The user will enter the time he wants.

## Features:
- Validation of labels for integer numbers and different from 0 with alert box.
- Increment and decrement buttons with continuous increase and decrease with button pressed.
- Time stored in Google Extension Storage.
- Timer with dynamic update and progress bar.
- Play and pause function.
- Reset function.
- Sound alert when ending a timer loop
